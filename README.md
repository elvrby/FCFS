## What is FCFS?
FCFS (First Come First Serve)  It's a scheduling algorithm used in computer systems and networks.
It means that the first process or job to arrive is the first to be executed or served.
This is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm, but it can sometimes lead to inefficient use of resources,
especially when there are a mix of long and short jobs.
